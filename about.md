## My name is Quinn Rohlf, and I build things

I've worked as a mobile applications developer, database guy, and freelance web designer. Currently, I'm working for OSHU building websites that make health data more useful for parents and children. If you'd like to check out my resume, I've got one online at [resume.qrohlf.com](http://resume.qrohlf.com).
