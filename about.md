# Hello!
I am a software developer, web designer, and student. I like to build interesting things and solve hard problems. When I'm not busy with school, I freelance as a web developer, work on a couple of [side](https://github.com/qrohlf/Lisst) [projects](https://github.com/qrohlf/rockthang), and write on this blog. I have a background in full-stack web development and spend a lot of time playing with design ideas and new ways to present content. I believe that simple and thoughtful design can make the world a better place, and I try to apply that philosophy to every aspect of the things that I create.

# Have a Project?
I'm currently accepting new clients. Please don't hesitate to take a look at my [portfolio](/projects), glance over my [resume](http://resume.qrohlf.com), or get in touch. if you're local, I'd love to discuss your project over coffee. Just shoot me an [email](mailto:qr@qrohlf.com).
