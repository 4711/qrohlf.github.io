summary: Inspiration and ideas from a few of my favorite hacker blogs

Whenever I’m embarking on a new design project, I typically start by surfing around to see some examples of how similar sites were designed. It’s a great way to get inspired as well as to inform yourself so that you can make sure your design is unique and memorable when compared to what’s already out there.

A lot has been said already about the merits of Jekyll as a minimalist publishing platform, but for a lot of Jekyll bloggers that minimalism extends to design as well. The handcrafted layouts I ran into while I was designing my own blog were some of the strongest examples of minimal, content-centric design that I’ve seen on the web. The 5 sites below are ones that I keep coming back to for inspiration when I’m working with a text-heavy project and a minimalist aesthetic.

# 1. Warpspire, by [@neath](https://twitter.com/kneath)

[Warpspire](http://warpspire.com) is a great example of how a well-chosen and contrasting color palette combined with good vertical rythm and typography can make a design pop without images or bright colors. Kyle Neath also has some great posts on design, making Warpspire a great place to get inspiration of all kinds.

# 2. Sparanoid, by [@tunghsiao](https://twitter.com/tunghsiao)

[Sparanoid](http://sparanoid.com/) makes great use of hover attributes and a high contrast black-and-white aesthetic to create a spacious feel for the site homepage. Each of the posts is customized with a unique background color and heading icon ([some](http://sparanoid.com/work/corner-bracket-lover/) [examples](http://sparanoid.com/work/instagram-badges/)), adding personality and playfulness to the design while still keeping a very professional and tight layout.
