Whenever I’m embarking on a new design project, I typically start by surfing around to see some examples of how similar sites were designed. It’s a great way to get inspired as well as to inform yourself so that you can make sure your design is unique and memorable when compared to what’s already out there.

A lot has been said already about the merits of Jekyll as a minimalist publishing platform, but for a lot of Jekyll bloggers that minimalism extends to design as well. Some of the sites I ran into while I was designing my own blog were the best examples of minimal, content-centric design that I’ve seen. The 5 sites below are ones that I keep coming back to for inspiration when I’m working with a text-heavy project and a minimalist aesthetic.
