# The Ugly Mug

Fairly large. Some outdoor seating options, plus some very well-worn couches + chairs. Good lattes. A bit louder than, say, Either/Or, but still a workable atmosphere. 

# Either/Or

Very small (3ish tables). Modern but not cold (unlike Jola!). Friendly staff. Doesn't really feel like a place to hang out in and work - good for meetings and maybe a post-run coffee stop. 

# Jola Cafe

Quite large, lots of communal tables.
